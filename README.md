# PPML: Machine Learning on Data you cannot see

Repository for the [tutorial](https://schedule.mozillafestival.org/session/3TAPD8-1) on **Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning** (`PPML`) presented at [SciPy 2023](https://www.scipy2023.scipy.org/)

Privacy guarantee is the most crucial requirement when it comes to analyse
sensitive data. In fact, sensitive data could not be shared nor moved from their
silos, let alone analysed in their raw form. As a result, data anonymization
techniques are used to generate a sanitised version of the original data. These
techniques are valuable tools to allow sensitive data to be used by Machine
Learning (ML) algorithms, but these methods alone are not enough to guarantee
complete privacy protection [6]. Moreover, multiple studies have demonstrated
that ML algorithms trained on private data suffer from a persistent vulnerability
that can unintentionally expose information about training samples [1] [3] [5].
This is particularly the case of Deep Neural Networks due to a hard-to-avoid
memoization effect in their internal parameters [1].

Differential privacy (DP) [2] is a system for publicly sharing information
about a dataset by describing the patterns of groups within the data, while withholding 
information about individuals. This technique has recently attracted in-
creasing interest from the ML community, as a method to quantify the anonymization of 
sensitive data during training [3] [2]. Moreover, DP integrates seamlessly into the whole
process, with no direct effect on its reproducibility.

In this talk, we will discuss how DP methods can be effectively used for
Privacy Preserving Machine learning. We will introduce the main theoretical
foundations of DP that are relevant for ML analyses. Afterwards, we will demon-
strate how DL models could be exploited [4] (i.e. inference attack ) to reconstruct
original training data by solely analysing models predictions, and how DP can
help to protect the privacy of our model, with minimal disruption to the original
training pipeline. Final remarks on more complex ML training and inference sce-
narios will be examined, considering specialised distributed federated learning
strategies.

## Get the material

Clone the current repository by running the following instructions:

```bash
cd $HOME  #¬†This will make sure you'll be in your HOME folder
git clone https://github.com/leriomaggio/ppml-cifris-23.git
```

**Note**: This will create a new folder named `ppml-cifris-23`. Move into this folder by typing:

```bash
cd ppml-cifris-23
```

Well done! Now you should do be in the right location.
Bear with me for another few seconds, following instructions reported below üôè

## Installation Instructions (or not üôÉ)

All the materials in this tutorial (code, and lecture notes) are made available as
Jupyter notebooks.

**(1)** There is no specific _hardware requirement_ to execute the code, i.e. running everything
on your laptop should be more than fine üòä.

**(2)**: As for the _software requirements_, we will be using a pretty standard Python/PyData stack:
`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn` for all the data science and Machine learning parts,
along with `pytorch` and `torchvision` to work on the Deep Learning examples.

Moreover, a few **extra** / specialised packages will be also featured:
- [Opacus](https://opacus.ai): A library to train PyTorch models with differential privacy
- [PHE](https://pypi.org/project/phe/): A Python 3 library implementing the Paillier Partially Homomorphic Encryption
- [Flower](https://flower.dev): A Federated Learning library for PyTorch


To get ready to run the code in this tutorial you could either (a) install and configure a (`conda`) environment
on your computer with all the necessary dependency; or (b) use [**Anaconda Notebooks**](https://nb.anaconda.cloud)
and run everything without installing anything at all on your computer.

Please refer to the [`setup.md`](./setup.md) document for step-by-step instructions, or to get a special
**discount code** to access Anaconda Notebooks.

If you spot any error/mistake, please feel free to reach out directly to [me](mailto:vmaggio@anaconda.com?subject=PPML%20SciPy23%20Issue), or to open an [Issue](http://github.com/leriomaggio/ppml-tutorial/issues)

Any feedback will be very much appreciated!

Thank you! üôè
